# CPU temperature
# These settings display a bar that starts to grow at 40° and maxes out at
# 50°.  It's updated every 10 seconds and displays the current temperature as

# CPU usage
# By default, i3bf-cpu displays a single vertical bar to indicate overall CPU
# usage.  In this example, PERCORE is enabled to display one bar per core.
# The default layout displays the load as a percentage next to a bar.  Because
# LAYOUT is used for each core, that would look cluttered and is therefore
# redefined to display a single block with separator_block_with=2 that
# displays only a vertical bar and a dynamic color, both indicating current
# core load.

# Network throughput
# The default layout displays a vertical bar for each direction (up and down),
# and the current transfer rate as a number if it is larger than 10% of the
# maximum rate.
# SCALE is set to "sqrt" to put more emphasis on smaller values; i.e. the
# vertical bar should reach half of its full height at 25% capacity.
